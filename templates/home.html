                <h4>Diabetes</h4>
                <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urinating often.</li>
                    <li>Feeling very thirsty.</li>
                    <li>Extreme fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Blurry vision.</li>

                <h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
                <p>Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.

                    After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>

                <h4>Chronic kidney disease</h4>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Nausea</li>
                    <li>Vomiting</li>
